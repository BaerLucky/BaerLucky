## :speak_no_evil: About Me

Hello, my name is Brian, How's it going? I was a floorcovering installer for most of my life. In 2017 I started to learn coding,
 on my own, as a hobby. That same year i had knee surgery which put an end to my floorcovering career. I worked in machine shops
 running CNC machines until 2020, when I had to have back surgery. Doing any kind of manual, physical labor after that was pretty
 much out of the question. I decided to take my self taught teachings of Web Development more serious.

 If i'm not working odd jobs, I'm teaching myself web development, If i'm not teaching myself web development,
 I'm hanging out with family and friends, If i'm not hanging out with family and friends, I'm sleeping.
